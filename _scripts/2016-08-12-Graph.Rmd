# Introduction

```{r include = FALSE}
library(quantmod)
library(dygraphs)

stock1 <- getSymbols("AMZN", auto.assign = FALSE,
                    from = "2016-01-01", end = Sys.Date())
stock2 <- getSymbols("AAPL", auto.assign = FALSE,
                    from = "2016-01-01", end = Sys.Date())
```


This report examines the price of two stocks: 
  
* AMZN
* AAPL 

It is written in [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com), an authoring format that enables easy creation of dynamic documents, presentations, and reports from R. R Markdown combines the core syntax of **markdown** (an easy to write plain text format) with embedded **R** code chunks that are run so their output can be included in the final document.

The data comes from [Yahoo finance](http://finance.yahoo.com).

### AMZN price

```{r echo = FALSE}
dygraph(Cl(stock1))
```

### AAPL price

```{r echo = FALSE}
dygraph(Cl(stock2))
```

### AMZN volume

```{r echo = FALSE}
dygraph(Vo(stock1))
```

### AAPL volume

```{r echo = FALSE}
dygraph(Vo(stock2))
